OpenHMD aims to provide a Free and Open Source API and drivers for immersive
technology, such as head mounted displays with built in head tracking. Our aim
is to implement support for as many devices as possible in a portable,
cross-platform package.

OpenHMD supports a wide range of devices such as Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Sony
PSVR, Deepoon E2 and others. We also support a Generic Android driver and a
External Sesnsor data driver to allow the use of our Sensor Fusion and features,
while providing your own data.
For a full support list please check the devices page on the website or wiki.
