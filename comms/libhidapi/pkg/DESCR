HIDAPI is a multi-platform library which allows an application to interface
with USB and Bluetooth HID-Class devices on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and Mac OS
X. On OpenBSD (like on FreeBSD), the backend uses libusb-1.0 to communicate
directly to a USB device. This back-end will of course not work with Bluetooth
devices.
