HIDAPI is a multi-platform library which allows an application to interface
with USB and Bluetooth HID-Class devices on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and Mac OS
X. On OpenBSD (like on FreeBSD), the backend uses libusb-1.0 to communicate
directly to a USB device. This back-end will of course not work with Bluetooth
devices.

HIDAPI also comes with a Test GUI. The Test GUI is cross-platform and uses Fox
Toolkit (http://www.fox-toolkit.org).  It will build on every platform which
HIDAPI supports.  Since it relies on a 3rd party library, building it is
optional but recommended because it is so useful when debugging hardware.
