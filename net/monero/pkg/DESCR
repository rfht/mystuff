Monero is a private, secure, untraceable, decentralised digital currency. You
are your bank, you control your funds, and nobody can trace your transfers
unless you allow them to do so.

Privacy: Monero uses a cryptographically sound system to allow you to send and
receive funds without your transactions being easily revealed on the blockchain
(the ledger of transactions that everyone has). This ensures that your
purchases, receipts, and all transfers remain absolutely private by default.

Security: Using the power of a distributed peer-to-peer consensus network, every
transaction on the network is cryptographically secured. Individual wallets have
a 25 word mnemonic seed that is only displayed once, and can be written down to
backup the wallet. Wallet files are encrypted with a passphrase to ensure they
are useless if stolen.

Untraceability: By taking advantage of ring signatures, a special property of a
certain type of cryptography, Monero is able to ensure that transactions are not
only untraceable, but have an optional measure of ambiguity that ensures that
transactions cannot easily be tied back to an individual user or computer.

This is the core implementation of Monero. It is open source and completely free
to use without restrictions, except for those specified in the license agreement
below. There are no restrictions on anyone creating an alternative
implementation of Monero that uses the protocol and network in a compatible
manner.
