Blockchain Synchronization
==========================

When monerod is started, it synchronizes with the blockchain and stores it in:

~/.bitmonero/lmdb/data.mdb

As of May 9, 2018 the size of the monero blockchain is 49.1GiB.

Performance
===========

Running monerod may put a strain on your system's resources, especially during
the initial synchronization of the blockchain. Temporary unresponsiveness of
the system and DNS lookup failures have been observed, each lasting several
seconds, but always temporary. To mitigate this, the following example
arguments to monerod may be of interest:

--max-concurrency 1
--block-sync-size 10
--limit-rate 500
