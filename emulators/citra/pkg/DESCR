Citra is an experimental open-source Nintendo 3DS emulator/debugger written in
C++. It is written with portability in mind, with builds actively maintained for
Windows, Linux and macOS. Citra only emulates a subset of 3DS hardware and
therefore is generally only useful for running/debugging homebrew applications.
Citra is even able to boot several commercial games.
