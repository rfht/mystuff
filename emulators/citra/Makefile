# Licensing:  This determines what we can distribute.
# When you determine the license type, make sure to look at ALL distfiles.
# Every distfile can have a different license.  The PERMIT_* values are
# determined by the most restrictive license.  If you have two licenses
# that are in conflict, set PERMIT_* based on the most restrictive one.
# Make SURE you get these values right.

# Put a comment there to state what's going on.
# Can be as brief as `BSD' or `GPLv2+', but it'd better be easy to check,
# if someone wants to double-check licensing.
# For GPL, the applicable versions must be included (e.g. v2+, v2 only, v3+).
# If all PERMIT_* are Yes, just setting 'PERMIT_PACKAGE_CDROM=Yes' is enough.
