Arx Libertatis is a cross-platform, open source port of Arx Fatalis, a
2002 first-person role-playing game and dungeon crawler developed by
Arkane Studios.

Arx Fatalis (Latin for "fatal fortress") is set on a world whose sun has
failed, forcing the above-ground creatures to take refuge in
subterranean caverns. The action in Arx Fatalis takes place in one of
these large caves, where inhabitants from all races such as Trolls,
Goblins, Dwarves, Humans, etc. have made their homes on various levels
of the cave. The player awakens inside a prison cell and, after making
his escape, eventually discovers his mission is to subvert and imprison
the God of Destruction, Akbaa, who is trying to manifest itself in Arx.
