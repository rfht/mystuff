The purpose of VCMI project is to rewrite entire HOMM 3: WoG engine from
scratch, giving it new and extended possibilities. We hope to support
mods and new towns already made by fans but abandoned because of game
code limitations.
VCMI is fan-made open-source project in progress. We already allow
support for maps of any sizes, higher resolutions and extended engine
limits. However, although working, the game is not finished. There are
still many features and functionalities to add, both old and brand new.
