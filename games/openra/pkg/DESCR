OpenRA is a project that recreates and modernizes the classic Command & Conquer
real time strategy games. We have developed a flexible open source game engine
(the OpenRA engine) that provides a common platform for rebuilding and
reimagining classic 2D and 2.5D RTS games (the OpenRA mods).

This means that OpenRA is not restricted by the technical limitations of the
original closed-source games: it includes native support for modern operating
systems and screen resolutions (including Windows 10, Mac OS X, and most Linux
distros) without relying on emulation or binary hacks, and features integrated
online multiplayer.

OpenRA is 100% free, and comes bundled with three distinct mods. When you run a
mod for the first time the game can automatically download the original game
assets, or you can use the original game disks.
