Flare (Free Libre Action Roleplaying Engine) is a simple game engine built to
handle a very specific kind of game: single-player 2D action RPGs. Flare is not
a reimplementation of an existing game or engine. It is a tribute to and
exploration of the action RPG genre.

Rather than building a very abstract, robust game engine, the goal of this
project is to build several real games and harvest an engine from the common,
reusable code.
