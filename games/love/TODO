Does *anything* work on this version?

- Ortho Robot doesn't http://stabyourself.net/orthorobot/
- Mari0 doesn't http://stabyourself.net/mari0/
- Mr. Rescue doesn't http://tangramgames.dk/games/mrrescue/
- Autumn doesn't http://bitoutsidethebox.com/autumn/
- .lazr. doesn't https://gaeel.itch.io/lazr
- Grid doesn't http://www.planimeter.org/grid/
- Project Hawkthorne doesn't https://projecthawkthorne.com/

Is this a port bug, or just upstream maintaining zero backwards compatibility?
Probably both.
