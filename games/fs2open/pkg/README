Game Files
==========

In order to play FreeSpace 2, you need to purchase the original game
and move its files to ~/.local/share/fs2open.

First, locate the folder with the FreeSpace2.exe executable. For the
gog.com version, this would be the 'app' subfolder which contains
several files, including the FreeSpace2.exe, Root_fs2.vp, and data
subfolder(s). (note that port innoextract can unpack gog.com Windows
installers.) Then copy or move all files and folders to
~/.local/share/fs2open

Cutscenes
=========

In order to get cutscenes to work (ten .mve or .MVE files), they need
to be in the data/movies directory. With the gog.com version, you can
find these files somewhere in the data2 and data3 directories. You may
need to create the data/movies directory yourself if it doesn't exist.

(fs2open does not support AVI versions of the cutscenes.)

Mods
====

In order to run mods, create a folder for each mod in
~/.local/share/fs2open and call fs2open like this:

fs2open -mod <modfolder>
