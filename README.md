# /usr/ports/mystuff

Repo of my own drafts. Note that I'm not representing the project in any way. This is meant to facilitate sharing of work-in-progress ports, especially when conflicting with existing ones in https://github.com/jasperla/openbsd-wip, or when the draft is too crude to put it there yet.

At any given time, all or none of these ports may be working, so if you decide to use it, you do so at your own risk.
