# /usr/ports/mystuff

Repo of my own drafts. Note that I'm not representing the project in any way. This is meant to facilitate sharing of work-in-progress ports, especially when conflicting with existing ones in https://github.com/jasperla/openbsd-wip, or when the draft is too crude to put it there yet.
