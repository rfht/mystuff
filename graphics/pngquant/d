pngquant is a PNG compressor that significantly reduces file sizes by converting images to a more efficient 8-bit PNG format with alpha channel (often 60-80% smaller than 24/32-bit PNG files). Compressed images are fully standards-compliant and are supported by all web browsers and operating systems.

Features

* High-quality palette generation
* advanced quantization algorithm with support for gamma correction and premultiplied alpha
* unique dithering algorithm that does not add unnecessary noise to the image
* Configurable quality level
* automatically finds required number of colors and can skip images which can't be converted with the desired quality
* Fast, modern code
* based on a portable libimagequant library
* C99 with no workarounds for legacy systems or compilers (apart from Visual Studio)
* multicore support (via OpenMP) and Intel SSE optimizations
